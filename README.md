# Dart Dash Documentation
This project is designed to index the Dart documentation.

## Setting up

I'm currently using Ruby to index Dart docs as it's what I've got installed on
the plain. I will update to use Dart as soon as possible.

    bundle install

## Running the indexing

To re-index the documentation in Dart.docset/Contents/Resources/Documentation
using:

    ruby index_dart_doc.rb
