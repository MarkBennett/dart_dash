A\n[Serialization] is defined in terms of [SerializationRule]s and supports\nreading and writing to different formats.\n\nSetup\n=====\nA simple example of usage is\n\n     var address = new Address();\n     address.street = 'N 34th';\n     address.city = 'Seattle';\n     var serialization = new Serialization()\n         ..addRuleFor(address);\n     String output = serialization.write(address);\n\nThis creates a new serialization and adds a rule for address objects. Right\nnow it has to be passed an address instance because of limitations using\nAddress as a literal. Then we ask the Serialization to write the address\nand we get back a Map which is a [json]able representation of the state of\nthe address and related objects.\n\nThe version above used reflection to automatically identify the public\nfields of the address object. We can also specify those fields explicitly.\n\n     var serialization = new Serialization()\n       ..addRuleFor(address,\n           constructor: \"create\",\n           constructorFields: [\"number\", \"street\"],\n           fields: [\"city\"]);\n\nThis rule still uses reflection to access the fields, but does not try to\nidentify which fields to use, but instead uses only the \"number\" and \"street\"\nfields that we specified. We may also want to tell it to identify the\nfields, but to specifically omit certain fields that we don't want\nserialized.\n\n     var serialization = new Serialization()\n       ..addRuleFor(address,\n           constructor: \"\",\n           excludeFields: [\"other\", \"stuff\"]);\n\nWriting Rules\n=============\nWe can also use a completely non-reflective rule to serialize and\nde-serialize objects. This can be more work, but it does work in\ndart2js, where mirrors are not yet implemented. We can specify this in two\nways. First, we can write our own SerializationRule class that has methods\nfor our Address class.\n\n     class AddressRule extends CustomRule {\n       bool appliesTo(instance, Writer w) => instance.runtimeType == Address;\n       getState(instance) => [instance.street, instance.city];\n       create(state) => new Address();\n       setState(Address a, List state) {\n         a.street = state[0];\n         a.city = state[1];\n       }\n     }\n\nThe class needs four different methods. The [appliesTo] method tells us if\nthe rule should be used to write an object. In this example we use a test\nbased on runtimeType. We could also use an \"is Address\" test, but if Address\nhas subclasses that would find those as well, and we want a separate rule\nfor each. The [getState] method should\nreturn all the state of the object that we want to recreate,\nand should be either a Map or a List. If you want to write to human-readable\nformats where it's useful to be able to look at the data as a map from\nfield names to values, then it's better to return it as a map. Otherwise it's\nmore efficient to return it as a list. You just need to be sure that the\n[create] and [setState] methods interpret the same way as [getState] does.\n\nThe [create] method will create the new object and return it. While it's\npossible to create the object and set all its state in this one method, that\nincreases the likelihood of problems with cycles. So it's better to use the\nminimum necessary information in [create] and do more of the work in\n[setState].\n\nThe other way to do this is not creating a subclass, but by using a\n[ClosureRule] and giving it functions for how to create\nthe address.\n\n     addressToMap(a) => {\"number\" : a.number, \"street\" : a.street,\n         \"city\" : a.city};\n     createAddress(Map m) => new Address.create(m[\"number\"], m[\"street\"]);\n     fillInAddress(Address a, Map m) => a.city = m[\"city\"];\n     var serialization = new Serialization()\n       ..addRule(\n           new ClosureRule(anAddress.runtimeType,\n               addressToMap, createAddress, fillInAddress);\n\nIn this case we have created standalone functions rather than\nmethods in a subclass and we pass them to the constructor of\n[ClosureRule]. In this case we've also had them use maps rather than\nlists for the state, but either would work as long as the rule is\nconsistent with the representation it uses. We pass it the runtimeType\nof the object, and functions equivalent to the methods on [CustomRule]\n\nConstant Values\n===============\nThere are cases where the constructor needs values that we can't easily get\nfrom the serialized object. For example, we may just want to pass null, or a\nconstant value. To support this, we can specify as constructor fields\nvalues that aren't field names. If any value isn't a String, or is a string\nthat doesn't correspond to a field name, it will be\ntreated as a constant and passed unaltered to the constructor.\n\nIn some cases a non-constructor field should not be set using field\naccess or a setter, but should be done by calling a method. For example, it\nmay not be possible to set a List field \"foo\", and you need to call an\naddFoo() method for each entry in the list. In these cases, if you are using\na BasicRule for the object you can call the setFieldWith() method.\n\n      s..addRuleFor(fooHolderInstance).setFieldWith(\"foo\",\n          (parent, value) => for (var each in value) parent.addFoo(value));\n\nWriting\n=======\nTo write objects, we use the write() method.\n\n      var output = serialization.write(someObject);\n\nBy default this uses a representation in which objects are represented as\nmaps keyed by field name, but in which references between objects have been\nconverted into Reference objects. This is then typically encoded as\na [json] string, but can also be used in other ways, e.g. sent to another\nisolate.\n\nWe can write objects in different formats by passing a [Format] object to\nthe [write] method or by getting a [Writer] object. The available formats\ninclude the default, a simple \"flat\" format that doesn't include field names,\nand a simple JSON format that produces output more suitable for talking to\nservices that expect JSON in a predefined format. Examples of these are\n\n     Map output = serialization.write(address, new SimpleMapFormat());\n     List output = serialization.write(address, new SimpleFlatFormat());\n     var output = serialization.write(address, new SimpleJsonFormat());\nOr, using a [Writer] explicitly\n     var writer = serialization.newWriter(new SimpleFlatFormat());\n     List output = writer.write(address);\n\nThese representations are not yet considered stable.\n\nReading\n=======\nTo read objects, the corresponding [read] method can be used.\n\n      Address input = serialization.read(input);\n\nWhen reading, the serialization instance doing the reading must be configured\nwith compatible rules to the one doing the writing. It's possible for the\nrules to be different, but they need to be able to read the same\nrepresentation. For most practical purposes right now they should be the\nsame. The simplest way to achieve this is by having the serialization\nvariable [selfDescribing] be true. In that case the rules themselves are also\nstored along with the serialized data, and can be read back on the receiving\nend. Note that this may not work for all rules or all formats. The\n[selfDescribing] variable is true by default, but the [SimpleJsonFormat] does\nnot support it, since the point is to provide a representation in a form\nother services might expect. Using CustomRule or ClosureRule also does not\nyet work with the [selfDescribing] variable.\n\nNamed Objects\n=============\nWhen reading, some object references should not be serialized, but should be\nconnected up to other instances on the receiving side. A notable example of\nthis is when serialization rules have been stored. Instances of BasicRule\ntake a [ClassMirror] in their constructor, and we cannot serialize those. So\nwhen we read the rules, we must provide a Map<String, Object> which maps from\nthe simple name of classes we are interested in to a [ClassMirror]. This can\nbe provided either in the [namedObjects] variable of the Serialization,\nor as an additional parameter to the reading and writing methods on the\n[Reader] or [Writer] respectively.\n\n    new Serialization()\n      ..addRuleFor(new Person(), constructorFields: [\"name\"])\n      ..namedObjects['Person'] = reflect(new Person()).type;\n","line":"183"}
